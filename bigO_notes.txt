Java parsing Notes:
    1. It could use for(;;) notation or for(x : list) notation
        1a. Or it could be while notation...lol. This will be such a bitch to look at.
        
    2. If the last column of the for(;;) notation is ++ or -- or += or -=, we have O(N)
    3. If the last column of the for(;;) notation is /= or *=, we have O(logN)
    4. If the first column is based on (N.length - a value) -> This is going to be a fixed value. So this is O(1)
    5. Determining merge sort or quicksort algorithms wouldn't be very easy...might need to focus on this last
    6. If we have an infinite loop, tell the user.

Python parsing notes:

    This will be a bitch to do.
    1. Its going to use for {var} in {list} every time. However, we'd need to account for the range input
    2. range(end, start, skip)
